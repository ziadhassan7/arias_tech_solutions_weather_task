Although it's a small task, I aimed to keep the design simple, clean, and easy to use while making it look as professional as possible within the given time.

When you start typing an address, the app shows you a list of suggestions to choose from. It also keeps track of your recent searches so you can easily revisit them. The list is ordered from the most recent and updates automatically, and it avoids duplicates. I used Hive as it is a really powerful tool.

## Edge Cases

I paid extra attention to edge-cases:

- **No Internet Connection:** Instead of the app freezing, it shows a friendly message letting you know thereâ€™s an issue.
- **Location Services Disabled:** If location services are off, the app shows a clear prompt, guiding you to turn it on through the settings.
